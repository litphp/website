This is our first blog entry. Since we are stepping forward to 0.9 release, here's a list of goal of the 0.9 version.

+ API should be stable enough. We don't want to do any BC break in future 1.0 release.
+ Complete documentation & project sites
+ Add some integrations and improve project creation process
+ Decide whether to rename the `Lit\Core` the namespace, git repo url, and packagist name is confusing right now
+ Keep improving test coverage

There're still many works remaining, so we don't have a timetable about this. For more details you may check [github project board](https://github.com/litphp/litphp/projects/1)
